This is the instructions for the 'read_pkts.py' routine. 

Please ensure you have read, and agree, to the terms of the code license:
https://github.com/SAR-UCL/CIRCE/blob/master/About/LICENSE
before proceeding. 

To run 'read_pkts.py' Python 3, and ideally 3.6, needs to be installed. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The routine is simple enough and only two things need changing. 

1. The file path needs to be defined. This is done through the 'path' 
variable on the 8th line. 

2. Decide what to run. By default the routine will display packet information 
(# of files, # packets in files, and types of packets) and not STIM. To view
STIM packets uncomment lines 118 and 119.
